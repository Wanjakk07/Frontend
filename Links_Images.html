    <h1>LINKS AND IMAGES PAGE</h1>
    <!--Notes for links and images-->

     <!--a "link" refers to an element that allows you to connect or hyperlink one web page or resource to another. 
    Links are an essential part of the web, as they enable navigation between different pages, websites, and online
     resources. They are often represented as clickable text, images, or other elements on a web page.
    
    The HTML <a> element, which stands for "anchor," is used to create links. 
        Here's a basic example of how an <a> element is used to create a link:-->
<!-- Types of links-->
<!--Generally there are two types of Links. Namely;
           1 ->Absolute Links -  Links that open other web pages. 
                An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination.

           2 ->Relative Links - Links that open pages within the same websites
                Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site.
        -->
    <!--Notes on Images-->
    <!--To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. 
            Unlike the other elements we have encountered, the <img> element is self-closing. 
            Empty, self-closing HTML elements do not need a closing tag.
        Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the
         page using a src attribute which tells the browser where the image file is located. 
         The src attribute works much like the href attribute for anchor tags.
It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths.-->
